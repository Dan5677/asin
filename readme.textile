h1. Introduction

There is already a sophisticated amazon gem out there called "ruby-aaws":http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-aws/, but ASIN in comparison is __reaaaaaaaaaly easy to use!__

It currently just supports the _ItemLookup_ via REST but is easy to extend and understand!

If you want to have a look at "the whole Amazon E-Commerce-API go here":http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceService/4-0/.

The code currently runs only on __Ruby 1.9__ due to encoding issues with the Amazon REST output (if YOU know how to backport this, you are welcome!).

require 'asin'

configure :secret => 'your-secret', :key => 'your-key'
