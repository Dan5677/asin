h1. Introduction

There is already a sophisticated amazon gem out there called "ruby-aaws":http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-aws/, but ASIN in comparison is __reaaaaaaaaaly easy to use!__

It currently just supports the _ItemLookup_ via REST but is easy to extend and understand!

If you want to have a look at "the whole Amazon E-Commerce-API go here":http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceService/4-0/.

The code currently runs only on __Ruby 1.9__ due to encoding issues with the Amazon REST output (if YOU know how to backport this, you are welcome!).

h2. Usage

<pre lang="ruby">
require 'asin'
include ASIN
# use the configure method to setup your api credentials
configure :secret => 'your-secret', :key => 'your-key'
# lookup an item with the amazon standard identification number (asin)
item = lookup '1430218150'
# have a look at the title of the item
item.title
=> Learn Objective-C on the Mac (Learn Series)
# access the internal data representation (Hashie::Mash)
item.raw.ItemAttributes.ListPrice.FormattedPrice
=> $39.99
</pre>
