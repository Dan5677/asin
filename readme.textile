h1. Introduction

There is already a sophisticated Amazon gem out there called ruby-aaws, but ASIN is __reaaaaaaaaaly easy to use!__

It currently just supports the _ItemLookup_ via REST but is easy to extend and understand.

If you want to have a look at "the whole Amazon E-Commerce-API go here":http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceService/4-0/.

The code currently runs only on __Ruby 1.9__ due to encoding issues with the Amazon REST output (if YOU know how to backport this, you are welcome!).

h2. How-To

All Amazon APIs require their calls to be signed with your API-Keys.

Since there is already a "decent Service":http://apisigning.com/ for this, no signing is implemented.

So you need to create an account at http://apisigning.com/ before using the gem!

h2. Usage

<pre>
item = ASIN.lookup '1430218150', :AWSAccessKeyId => 'your-api-key'
